                <p>
                    I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 7+ years of experience transforming unstable, outdated systems into fast, reliable platforms.

                <p>I specialize in:</p>

                    <ul className="checkBulletList">
                        <li>API Integrations (Nextiva, Zoom, SMS platforms)</li>
                        <li>Legacy System Modernization (.NET 4, AngularJS 1.0 → Stabilized and expanded)</li>
                        <li>Database Optimization (Reduced multi-day SQL waits to under 3 hours)</li>
                        <li>Infrastructure & Server Setup (Built full QA environment from scratch)</li>
                        <li>Real-Time Application Development (Text-messaging opt-ins, live survey feedback)</li>

                    Whether it's cutting a 10-minute report down to under a second, saving clients from churn with real-time demos, or stabilizing production systems that used to require server restarts every two weeks — I deliver real, measurable impact across the stack.
